The code on the ribbon is:
GMODCDOOKCDBIOYDRMKDPQLDPVWYOIVRVSEOV

Which means nothing, so I rot13'd it 'til the letters looked right (Conatins F, L, A and G).
WCETSTEEASTRYEOTHCATFGBTFLMOEYLHLIUEL

But that didn't do much, until I stumbled on scytale coding.

With 3 turns we get:
WELCOMETOTHESCYTALETHEFLAGISBUTTERFLY
