First I stared at the gif for a while, I was tired don't look at me like that..

The I blinked and saw a face in the haze.. huh..

So ImageMagick to the rescue!
$convert tv.gif -transparent white output.gif

Each frame seems to be random noise, but with the transparent white pixels when you mix two frames you get faces (see challenge156(1-4).png)

Huh, that fourth one has some text:
FLAG-AcsW3fK9NxJMn2
