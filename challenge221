I first I tried launching 'vi' command to get a shell with the well known :

:set shell /bin/bash
:shell

But it wasn't working.

I knew that vi was launched because of the delay but it seemed to quit automatically.



I then connected to level1 (because we know that it's on the same lxc container)
and launched a 'working' shell 

bash 1>&2


It seemed that prompt.sh was launching "real.sh" each time I launched a command.

Then I thought it would be interesting trap the EXIT signal with a "vi" command that would let me read/write files.

Hopefully "trap" and "vi" and EXIT wasn't filtered by the script so 
i entered trap "vi" EXIT and finally got vi running "in blind mode", so on level1 shell, I looked for a read/write place.

/tmp was no more writeable (it was before ^^).

I tried /run/shm => BINGO :-)

In my "blind"-vi I just typed :

:r /home/level4/flag.txt
:w /run/shm/yeah.txt

and got the result on the level1 shell.

cat /run/shm/yeah.txt

source of prompt.sh :

#!/bin/bash
./real.sh 2>/dev/null
