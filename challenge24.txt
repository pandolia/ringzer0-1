We are given a zip file, extracting that give us an image of an ext3 partition, this partition contains a todo file that contains the line:
-restric my my little brother permission to delete file.

As we all know, todo files are where we put the things we never get around to...

Whoa, two "new" files..

one seems to the same odg file that we already had, the other is called secret.sve, and comes in at naught but 4.8TB...
